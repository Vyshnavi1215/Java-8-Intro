Java-8-Introduction

Classes:

Class is the collection of data about a particular entity(object).

java is very passionate about classes

For example Car,car will have properties like color, company,name, weight etc, and some of the functionalities like start, drive, break.

So, the properties would be defined as variables and the functionalities would be the methods. encapsulating these variables and methods together we call as Class.

Class is the natural home of data and the methods.

Example : class Car{
type variable 1; //variables, type :type defines the datatype of value(Data type : defines that which type of data that the variable can hold like interger, string)
type variable2;


}


Variables : Variables are the identifiers and they store the data.

Methods : code to perform the particular task.
